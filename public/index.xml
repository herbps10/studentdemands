      <description>The Covid-19 epidemic and the murder of George Floyd precipitated a wave of student activism in 2020. This website is a database of the demands students have presented to their educational institutions in response. The intention of the project is to document the work of student activists and to serve as a resource for activists drafting new campaigns at their institutions.
The database currently contains 47 documents from 37 institutions.</description>
